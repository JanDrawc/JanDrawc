        Supreme over other kings, lordly in appearance,<br>
        he is the hero, born of Uruk, the goring wild bull.<br>
        He walks out in front, the leader,<br>
        and walks at the rear, trusted by his companions.<br>
        Mighty net, protector of his people,<br>
        raging flood-wave who destroys even walls of stone!<br>
        Gilgamesh is strong to perfection,<br>
        <br>
        It was he who opened the mountain passes,<br>
        who dug wells on the flank of the mountain.<br>
        It was he who crossed the ocean, the vast seas, to the rising sun,<br>
        who explored the world regions, seeking life.<br>
        It was he who restored the cities that the Flood had destroyed!<br>
        for teeming mankind.<br>
        <br>
        Who can compare with him in kingliness?<br>
        Who can say like Gilgamesh: "I am King!"?<br>
        Whose name, from the day of his birth, was called "Gilgamesh"?<br>
        <br>
        Two-thirds of him is god, one-third of him is human.<br>
        The Great Goddess designed the model for his body,<br>
        she prepared his form ...<br>
        beautiful, handsomest of men,<br>
        <br>
        ... perfect<br>
        <br>
        ... powerful<br>
        <br>
        ... King Gilgamesh
